<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm an undergraduate student studying at Queensland University of Technology currently in my penultimate year.
Since I was a child, I have been fascinated with the field of Information Technology and have decided to persue a career in
subject. Over the past few years I have been expanding my field of view in this area and have come to a realisation that 
my passion lies within software development, more specifically, machine learning.
