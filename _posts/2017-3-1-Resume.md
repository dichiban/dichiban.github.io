It is that time of the year again where students rack their brains over their resumes and so I have joined their battalion.
Have you ever just looked back into a project or document you finished a few years ago only to realise now that they weren't quite the same as you remember? Yup. It's that time of the year 
again where I look at this tattered document so called "resume" and wonder what is going on.

In order to prevent this piece of paper reaching out to the world I have decided to partake in Queensland Univeristy of Technology's resume writing event which will kickstart
my resume. The event itself is a workshop that teaches students about how to construct a resume that can stand out from the crowd.

The objective is to:
</div>
* Understand the purpose of résumé as a self-marketing tool
* Prepare a professional résumé appropriate to prospective employer expectations
* Consider how to tailor your résumé to suit different position requirements
* Learn how to write a targeted ‘Career Profile’
* Learn how to market your ‘Employment History’ to industry
* Learn how to articulate your ‘Transferable Skills’

With this I will reshape my resume to an industry standard.
