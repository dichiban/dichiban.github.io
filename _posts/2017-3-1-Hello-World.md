Hey for any of those visiting this profile for the first time, my name is Daiki! I'm currently trying to build up multiple resources to publicise myself for 
the future. You can find my email, Facebook, Github, and LinkedIn links in the footer below. Hopefully I will be submitting posts ranging from technical views 
on projects I'm working on or just random rambles from time to time on this website!

Please feel free to contact me at any time!
