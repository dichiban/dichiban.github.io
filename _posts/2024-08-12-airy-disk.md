<h3>Definitions</h3>

<h4>Aperture</h4>

- How much light is being passed through a lens
- Controlled by closing up or opening up the fans in the lens
- Measured in f stops
- Lower f stop means more light and thinner focal plane
- Higher f stop means less light and wider focal plane

<h4>Diffraction</h4>

- Light bending and spreading out due to obstacles
- More apparent as you go a higher f stop

<h4>Airy Disk</h4>

- Light pattern that occurs due to diffraction of light through a circular aperture (lens)
- Pattern is a central bright spot with rings propegating around it

{% picture images/airy_disk/airy_disk_ring_multi.png %}

- The rings are called **Airy Rings**  

<h4>Angular Diameter</h4>

- Value used to describe how large a sphere/circle is from a given point of view

<h3>Application</h3>

<h4>Rayleigh Criterion</h4>

- Funamental principle used to determine the resolution limit of an optical system
- It calculates the the minimum angular distance between two points of light sources that allows them to be distinctly identified as separate objects. 
- Essentially as long as the airy disk from one source does not coincide with the other light sources airy disk the object can theoretically be distinctly identified

$$ \theta â‰ˆ 1.22 \times \dfrac{\lambda}{d}$$

- $$ \theta $$ is angular diameter in radians
- $$ \lambda $$ is the wavelength of the light
- d is the diameter of the aperture
- Assumes aperture is perfectly circular
- Assumes only one wavelength range.

```python
import math
import numpy as np

# Parameters
# Wavelength in meters
wavelength = 550e-9
# Aperture diameter in meters
D = 0.1

ang_dist_rad = 1.22 * wavelength/D
ang_dist_deg = ang_dist_rad * (180 / math.pi)
ang_dist_arc = ang_dist_rad * (180 * 3600 / math.pi)
print(ang_dist_rad)
# 6.71e-06
print(ang_dist_deg)
# 0.0003844546805327824
print(ang_dist_arc)
# 1.3840368499180167
```

- Calculation above means that for the wavelength of 550nm (green) with an apecture of 10cm we can theoretically distinguish two light sources that are 1.384 arcseconds away from eachother 

<h3>Appendix</h3>

```python
# Generate Airy Disk and Rings
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.special import jn  

# Parameters
# Wavelength in meters
wavelength = 550e-9
# Aperture diameter in meters
D = 0.1  
# Pixel size in meters
pixel_size = 2e-7
# Size of the simulation grid  
size = 1024

# Create a grid
x = np.linspace(-size/2, size/2, size) * pixel_size
y = np.linspace(-size/2, size/2, size) * pixel_size
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)

# Calculate wavenumber
k = 2 * np.pi / wavelength

# Airy pattern calculation
alpha = k * D * R / (2 * np.pi)
intensity = (2 * jn(1, alpha) / alpha)**2

# Scale for better visualisation
intensity_log = np.log10(intensity + 1e-2)  

# Normalize the intensity between 0 and 1
intensity_log -= np.min(intensity_log)
intensity_log /= np.max(intensity_log)

# Plot the Airy disk and rings
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.imshow(intensity_log, 
           extent=[x.min(), x.max(), y.min(), y.max()], 
           cmap='inferno', 
           origin='lower')          
plt.colorbar(label='Logarithmic Intensity')
plt.title('Airy Disk and Airy Rings Pattern')
plt.xlabel('meters')
plt.ylabel('meters')
plt.savefig("airy_disk_ring")
plt.show()
