title: Selenium?
---

<div style="text-align: justify">
Today a good friend of mine decided to buy some expensive Nike shoes online that started their
online order from 6pm. I watched as he failed to grab a pair and thought to myself, "hey, couldn't 
I write a script to aid his purchase?" and decided to write a python script that utilises the 
Selenium module.

The only problem I have faced so far is the speed at which some of the click() commanmd occur. It may have to do with the limitations of Selenium or there may be an issue in the way I am retrieving the 
html elements.
